# **Welcome to** HACK **club inaugural event!**

 >**Date**: 5 December 2020, Saturday
  <br>**Time**: 10:30 AM - 11:30 AM IST

**Invited talk by:** *Dr. Pallab Majhi, Senior Solutions Architect-Deep Learning, NVIDIA* <br>
<br>
**Topic Title:** *Developers' Approach to Multi-Camera Large-Scale Intelligent Video
Analytics*

**Abstract:** *Intelligent Video Analytics (IVA) has been one of the pillars of for IoT and
Smart cities as billions of video sensors has been deployed worldwide, generating
massive amounts of data.  At this juncture a multi-camera based scalable architecture
is imperative which can turn this massive data in to rich insights in areas such as
traffic management and optimization, retail analytics, smart parking and many more.
In this webinar we will discuss an approach from a developers' perspective when
designing such a computing system for video analytics. We will take a use case
scenario and walk through the major systems design, decisions and techniques to
arrive at a deployable and scalable system.*

**Key takeaways:**
- Understanding challenges in designing an IVA system.
- Some techniques to improve the IVA development.
- A scalable systems architecture for IVA applications.
- Working with multi-camera systems.
